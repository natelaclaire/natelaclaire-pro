Several years ago, the web site Dream.In.Code created a year-long challenge called [52 Weeks of Code](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/forum/126-52-weeks-of-code/). The goal was to experience new languages, programming concepts, and techniques and, ultimately, to become a better programmer.

I've decided to follow this example for the coming year. Each week, I'll share how I've used something that is new to me and is related to programming. I'll include an explanation of what I did, challenges I encountered, pros and cons, and, when appropriate, will also include a GitHub repository for the project.

I'm looking forward to expanding my horizons and sharing my experiences with you!

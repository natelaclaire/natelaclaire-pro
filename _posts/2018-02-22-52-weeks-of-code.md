Several years ago, the web site Dream.In.Code created a year-long challenge called [52 Weeks of Code](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/forum/126-52-weeks-of-code/). The goal was to experience new languages, programming concepts, and techniques and, ultimately, to become a better programmer.

I've decided to follow this example for the coming year. Each week, I'll share how I've used something that is new to me and is related to programming. For example, next week, March 2, I'll be sharing my first experience creating a basic desktop app with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using the [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) framework. I'll include an explanation of what I did, challenges I encountered, pros and cons, and will also include a GitHub repository for the project.

I'm looking forward to expanding my horizons and sharing my experiences with you!
